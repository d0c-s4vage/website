Production website

This website is intended to become the Production website for KPLUG San Diego, a subsidiary of the San Diego Computer Society.

Members of KPLUG San Diego are welcome to contribute to the creation and maintenance of this website.

The following are fundamental groundrules for this website (subject to change)
-- As expected, website code shall be served by Github pages, ie the gh-pages branch.
-- If someone wishes to propose radical changes which may fundamentally alter or diverge from existing code, it's advisable to create a separate "staging only" branch for these kinds of extreme changes. If those changes are accepted, they may be merged into the gh-pages branch or otherwise injected.
-- The website shall fundamentally be built as a static website which typically means that all code shall be HTML or Markdown, and any script functionality shall run client-side.
-- Initially this website shall be built using the Jekyll framework, but may be subject to change.
-- Any additional JS frameworks may be implemented/added. Recommended implementation is to declare a CDN in the head.

Any questions, comments, suggestions may be PM'd to me via the KPLUG email system or if has continuing value submitted as an "Issue" for this website repository.
Welcome!
